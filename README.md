# MedAlarm

## Overview
The MedAlarm App is a comprehensive solution designed to help patients remember to take their prescribed medications, ensuring better adherence to treatment plans. The application targets both mobile and web platforms, providing users with a seamless experience across devices. 

## Achievements
- My team and I had multiple meetings with stakeholders to get an accurate read on what they required of us.
- We created and meticulously updated an SRS document to house the project requirements and features, interfaces, and other descriptive information. 
- We researched architectures and picked one that best suited our solution.
- We researched techonologies in order to find a best fit for our solution.
- Using our research, we developed a budget and a timeline for our solution.
- Conducted biweekly presentations to our peers showing our progress.
- We developed UML documents to map user journeys, user stories, and specific workflows to get a better idea of the user interfaces.
- We created tables to show the processes of the database and OOP class diagrams in order to map out the structure of the application.
- We wireframed and prototypes user interaces.
